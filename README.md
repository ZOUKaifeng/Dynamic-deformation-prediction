# Dynamic-deformation-prediction
Dynamic deformation of 3D human body prediction based on LSTM and SMPL.  
##The prediction of cloth deformation.  
We made a cloth dataset based on the human motion of [AMASS dataset](https://amass.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/).  
The link to our dataset is https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GuzDpTXm3fKa2GNemIyGkmQMjgZZ1ACI/view?usp=sharing.  
We use [CoMA](https://coma.is.tue.mpg.de/) to reduce the dimension of cloth mesh, then predict the deformation by LSTM.
